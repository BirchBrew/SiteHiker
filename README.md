# Blue Harvest
I'll try scraping, that's a good trick!

## Contributing
I highly recommend the [ElixirLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls) extension for Visual Studio Code

## Demo
- clone the repo
- run `mix deps.get`
- run `mix run --no-halt`
- open http://localhost:9000 and try it out!
